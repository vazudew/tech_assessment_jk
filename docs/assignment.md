## Objective
Automate the installation and configuration of the Jenkins
continuous integration server.

## Requirements
(a) The solution must run on a clean installation of the chosen operating system
without errors.

(b) Jenkins and its prerequisites must be installed without manual intervention.

(c) Jenkins must be configured to serve requests over port 8000.

NOTE: It is not sufficient to forward port 8000 on either the host or the guest OS to
the default Jenkins port. Jenkins itself must be configured to listen on port 8000.

(d) Subsequent applications of the solution should not cause failures or repeat
redundant configuration tasks

## Instructions

You can complete this exercise using your choice of automation tool or language.
You do not need to produce a Puppet language solution. The emphasis should be on
a working solution that satisfies the requirements.

__Please attach__ :

(1) Your code solution in the file format in which it is expected to run.

(2) A brief paragraph with the instructions for running your solution. Please
explicitly state all assumptions (e.g. Only runs on RHEL)

(3) Answers to the following questions

* Describe the most difficult hurdle you had to overcome in implementing
your solution.
* Please explain why requirement (d) above is important.
* Where did you go to find information to help you?
* Briefly explain what automation means to you, and why it is important
to an organization's infrastructure design strategy.

Have fun and good luck. We look forward to receiving your completed exercise.
